# Java Design Patterns Challenge - DIO

This project demonstrates the implementation of three design patterns: Singleton, Facade, and Strategy in Java.

#### Files
- `Singleton.java`: Implements the Singleton pattern to manage weather information.
- `Facade.java`: Implements the Facade pattern to simplify access to city information (city and state of birth).
- `Strategy.java`: Defines the Strategy pattern to determine age ranges based on different criteria.

#### Usage
1. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - `Singleton.java` ensures a single instance of the class for weather information management.

2. **Facade Pattern:**
   - `Facade.java` provides a simplified interface to interact with `CityInformationFacade` and retrieve city and state of birth information.

3. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - `Strategy.java` defines interfaces and implementations to determine age ranges such as `YoungStrategy.java`, `AdultStrategy.java`, `ElderlyStrategy.java`.

### Objective

- The objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of Singleton, Facade, and Strategy design patterns in Java. Each pattern is implemented independently to showcase how they can enhance the structure, modularity, and code reusability in Java applications.

#### Final Considerations

This project provided a valuable opportunity to explore and apply design patterns in a real-world context. Each demonstrated pattern offers specific benefits that can be leveraged and adapted for various software development needs.
