# Object-Oriented Programming Practice Challenge - DIO

This Java project aims to simulate the management of a Bootcamp using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Implemented Features

### Courses

- **Abstraction**
  - **Definition:** The ability to focus on essential aspects of a domain, ignoring less important or accidental characteristics. Objects are abstractions of entities existing in the domain.

- **Encapsulation**
  - **Definition:** Hides the implementation details of objects, improving system maintenance and evolution.

- **Inheritance**
  - **Definition:** Allows a subclass to reuse, extend, or modify the behavior of a superclass.

- **Polymorphism**
  - **Definition:** Objects can be referenced in multiple ways, allowing flexibility in using objects of specific classes as instances of a more general class.

### Domain

- **Class**
  - **Definition:** Represents real-world objects with attributes and methods that define their behavior.

- **Attribute**
  - **Definition:** Data structures representing the characteristics of a class.

- **Variable**
  - **Definition:** A memory region used to store data during program execution.

- **Method**
  - **Definition:** Defines the behavior and actions of objects and classes.

- **Object**
  - **Definition:** An instance of a class encapsulating properties and behaviors defined by the class.

- **Instance**
  - **Definition:** A new object created from a class using the `new` operator.

### Developers

- **Developer Registration**
  - **Implementation:** Creation of Dev objects to represent developers participating in the Bootcamp, specifying their skills and participation.

### Mentors

- **Mentor Registration**
  - **Implementation:** Creation of Mentor objects to represent specialists offering mentorship in the Bootcamp, detailing their areas of expertise and commitment.

## Objective

- Implement a Java system to manage a Bootcamp with courses, mentorship, and developers.
- Utilize OOP concepts to model and implement necessary functionalities.

## Project Information

1. Bootcamp Domain Modeling
2. Classes and Relationships Implementation
3. Application of OOP Principles

## Final Considerations

- This project offers an excellent opportunity to apply and enhance your knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming and Java.
