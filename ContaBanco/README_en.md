# Syntax Challenge - DIO

This project is a solution to the challenge proposed by Digital Innovation One (DIO) in the Syntax module, where I developed a simple application to simulate characteristics of a bank account.

## Challenge Description

The goal of the challenge was to create a Java program called `ContaBanco` that allows the user to input data via the terminal, representing attributes of a bank account. After entering the data, the program should display a personalized message with the provided information.

### Attributes of the Bank Account

| Attribute      | Type     | Example       |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Number         | Integer  | 1021          |
| Agency         | String   | 067-8         |
| Client's Name  | String   | MARIO ANDRADE |
| Balance        | Decimal  | 237.48        |

## Instructions

1. Compile and execute the `AccountTerminal.java` class.
2. Follow the instructions in the terminal to enter the required data: account number, agency, client's name, and balance.
3. After entering all the information, the program will display a personalized message with the provided data.

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice concepts such as terminal input, string manipulation, and output formatting in Java.
