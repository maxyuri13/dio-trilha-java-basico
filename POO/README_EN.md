# iPhone Component Modeling and Diagramming Challenge (OOP) - DIO

This repository contains my solution to the challenge of modeling and diagramming the UML representation of an iPhone component, covering its functionalities as a Music Player, Phone, and Internet Browser.

## Context

Based on the [2007 iPhone launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ou608QQRq8), I created UML diagrams of classes and interfaces using PlantUML. Subsequently, I implemented these diagrams in Java files.

## Modeled Functionalities

### Music Player

- Methods:
  - `play()`
  - `pause()`
  - `selectSong(String song)`

### Phone Device

- Methods:
  - `call(String number)`
  - `answer()`
  - `startVoicemail()`

### Internet Browser

- Methods:
  - `displayPage(String url)`
  - `addNewTab()`
  - `refreshPage()`

## Objective

- Create a UML diagram that represents the described functionalities.
- Optionally, implement corresponding Java classes and interfaces.

## Instructions

1. Watch the iPhone launch video to understand the main functionalities.
2. Use a UML tool of your preference to create the class and interface diagram.
3. Optionally, implement the Java classes represented in your UML diagram.
4. Submit your GitHub repository according to DIO platform guidelines. For example:

   `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/challenges/oop/README.md`

## Final Considerations

- This project is a great opportunity to practice Object-Oriented concepts, UML modeling, and Java implementation.
